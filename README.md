# Rock-Scissor-Paper

Rock-Paper-Scissors (or RPS) is a classic hand game typically played between two people. It is often used as a simple decision-making tool or as a casual game for fun. The game has three possible hand signs, and the outcome depends on the combination of the signs chosen by the players.

How to Play:
Players: 2
Hand Signs:
Rock: Represented by a closed fist.
Paper: Represented by an open hand with fingers extended.
Scissors: Represented by a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a "V" shape.
Steps to Play:
Both players count aloud: "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!" (or a similar rhythm).
On the word "Shoot," both players simultaneously reveal their chosen hand sign.
Rules:
Each hand sign either wins, loses, or ties against another hand sign. The rules for determining the winner are:

Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)
If both players choose the same sign, it is a tie, and the game is replayed.
Winning Strategy:
Unpredictability: The key to success in Rock-Paper-Scissors is being unpredictable. If you become too predictable, your opponent can anticipate your next move and win.
Pattern Recognition: Try to recognize patterns in your opponentâ€™s choices. People often subconsciously repeat a sign after using it successfully or change if they lose.
Possible Outcomes:
Player 1 Wins: If Player 1's hand sign beats Player 2's.
Player 2 Wins: If Player 2's hand sign beats Player 1's.
Draw: If both players choose the same hand sign
